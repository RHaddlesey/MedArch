<h1><span class="fltlft style8">Akkerman fortress, Ukraine</span></h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p align="justify">Akkerman is an Ottoman fortress in Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Ukraine. Richard is involved in producing geophysical scans (resistivity, magnetometery and radar) of the interior to find the original medieval buildings. In 2008 we also hope to conduct some dendrochronological investigations.</p>
<p align="justify">I returned from another geophysics season in Ukraine on the 24th of  July. I worked out there with Alex Turner (Soviet Al not the Artic  Monkey) doing GPR (<a href="http://www.malags.com/Solutions/Application-Areas/Archeology---Forensics.aspx">Mala</a> Ground Penetrating Radar) and Magnetometry (Geoscan FM36 Fluxgate <a href="http://www.geoscan-research.co.uk/page28.html">Gradiometer</a>). Last year we used a Resistivity machine (Geoscan <a href="http://www.geoscan-research.co.uk/page15.html">RM15</a>)  and so where able to combine the results of the three methods to create  a better picture of the archaeology that remains below the surface at  the <a href="http://www.akkermanfortress.org/">Akkerman Fortress</a>. Alex and I are still in the process of interpreting the results and building a GIS (<a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/about/desktop_gis.html">ESRI ArcGIS</a>) map that includes all the geophysical survey illustrations / a DGPS (<a href="http://www.trimble.com/mgis_gpsrec.shtml">Trimble</a> Differential Global Positioning System) / a Total Station survey and  past and present maps. The results of which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.medievalarchitecture.net/files/Akkerman_Survey_Report_2008.pdf">here</a> or viewed in your browser <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14767160/Akkerman-Survey-Report-2008">here</a><a href="http://www.medievalarchitecture.net/Ukraine.html"></a></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">I have also created some interesting <a href="http://photosynth.net/Search.aspx?query=rhaddlesey">photosynths</a> (3d models) of the keep and the survey. They are well worth a look. It does involve installing a Microsoft addon, but it really is worth it.

          </p>
          <p align="justify">Akkerman Fortress, Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky, Ukraine</p>
          <p align="justify">A  geophysical pilot study was undertaken, during August 2007, of the  Akkerman fortress, in the Ukraine, by Alex Turner and Richard  Haddlesey, from the University of Winchester (UK). The primary aim of  this initial survey was to ascertain the effectiveness of a geophysical  survey, to aid and advance the understanding of the Ottoman phase of  the site. </p>
          <p align="justify">As the geography of the area was unknown, the  geophysical instrument chosen for this initial survey was the  resistivity meter, as the nature of this instrument offers the highest  probability of results under these conditions. A vital requirement of  such a survey is a small degree of ground moisture, as this provides a  path for the electrical current to flow, from one probe on the meter,  to the other. Although the aridity of the southern coast of the Ukraine  would normally have an adverse effect upon the instrument readings, a  thunderstorm during the initial stages provided the required ground  conditions. Toward the end of the survey, this had virtually dried out,  making viable results more difficult to achieve. </p>
          <p align="justify">Due to  the dry terrain and compressed earth, from many years of tourist  access, it was decided to carry out a brief survey, employing 1m  spacing over a 20m grid. This was purely to determine whether it was  possible to collect any meaningful data (fig. 1 illustrates the  result). This particular grid was chosen after walking the site, as it  seemed to offer the best possibility of achieving good results. This  was due to a visible inserted roof line and remains of a wall; the only  contemporary structural evidence not yet under archaeological  investigation. The resulting grid data was downloaded onto a laptop and  processed in Geoplot 3. A jpeg image was then exported for  geo-referencing in the Geographical Information System (GIS) program,  ESRI ArcView 9.2 (fig 2). The image was also downloaded onto a Nokia  N80 mobile phone to facilitate the comparison of data analysis, with  on-site evidence, in real time. The results were very encouraging and a  further ten grids were surveyed at a higher resolution of 0.5m  intervals in 20m grids, rendering higher quality results.</p>
          <p align="justify">Official Akkerman Fortress Project <a href="http://www.akkermanfortress.org.ua/akkerman_face/external/main/go/aqk_home">Home Page</a><br />
          </p>
          <p align="justify">Following  the Akkerman survey, an expedition to three other fortresses in the  Southern Ukraine was undertaken. No geophysical surveys were carried  out during the expedition, but their plausibility was assessed by  Richard Haddlesey, one of the geophysics team. The following is a  report on this expedition.</p>
          <p align="justify">Kerch Fortress, Crimea, Ukraine (20/08/07)<br />
            There is good potential at this site, for a geophysical survey to shed  light on the interior of the fortress. I would suggest that both  resistivity and magnetometery and, possibly, ground penetrating radar  (GPR), would yield good results, though the jagged undulations of the  site might make a GPR survey difficult. As with Akkerman, the ground is  very dry during the summer months and I would suggest that an earlier  Easter date would provide better environmental conditions for the  survey. The site is situated on top of an exposed hill, covered in  rough scrub approximately 0.6m high. This conceals numerous holes and  jagged stones, potentially creating a hazardous working environment. It  would be safer if the scrub could be cleared, prior to any survey.  Alternatively, I suggest that protective clothing should be provided,  such as safety boots and protective gaiters and teams should operate in  groups of two or three. <br />
            Very little of this fortress survives beyond the main external wall  and, therefore, a geophysical survey would provide a valuable insight  as to what remains of the interior. Large areas of this site could be  surveyed (c 100mx100m), potentially yielding positive results,  providing that the ground has adequate moisture. Because of the rough  terrain, I would estimate an average work rate of four to five 20m  grids, in a straight line, per day; less, if the grids need to be set  out along differing alignments.</p>
          <p align="justify">Arabat, on the Crimean Spit, Southern Ukraine (21/08/07)<br />
            A straightforward survey could be problematic at this site. As with the  above fortress, only the outer walls remain. However, the interior has  experienced recent burning and, in some areas, is covered in deep  deposits of sand and small shells. The resulting lack of vegetation has  revealed more of the site and, as only the top layer was burnt, it will  not adversely affect the instrument readings. What would hinder a  survey is the site aridity and depth of the sand, though remains of  some buildings can be traced in the topography and structural remains  are visible in some areas. The survey methods I would recommend are, as  before, resistivity, magnetometery and GPR but, in conjunction with  GPS. Due to the terrain, large grid areas may prove difficult and,  therefore, I would suggest that only three to four 20m grids would be  possible per day. Again, the ground is very dry and I would advise that  the survey be carried out in wetter periods. From an archaeological  perspective, the exterior of the site could also yield some very  interesting data, based on the adjacent topography and previous  experience of the author.<br />
          </p>
          <p align="justify">Dyke Bastion, Crimea, Southern Ukraine (21/08/07)<br />
            This site appears to be the remains of a single defensive bastion,  built at the end of a long dyke, over-looking the sea. To the south of  the bastion is a possible entrance, cut into the dyke to provide  access. The topography and visible earthworks suggest that some form of  building once stood there and would prove an interesting area to  conduct a resistivity survey, conditions permitting. As there is little  archaeological knowledge of this area, some small test pits would  assist in further interpretation.</p>
          <p align="justify">Dyke Fortress, Crimea, Southern Ukraine (21/08/07)<br />
            This fortress is earlier in date than the others visited and shows  little evidence of stone-built fortifications. There appears to be an  earthen ditch and bank construction, with possible mud and earth, or  wooden structures, in the interior. For this reason I would recommend  the use of resistivity and GPR to locate any other ditches and possible  stake, or postholes. The lack of stone-built structures and, some  evidence of archaeological stratigraphy, requires a limited programme  of excavation, in order to verify any anomalies suggested by the survey  data. <br />
            The site was very dry and the scrub had been burnt, providing an ideal  surface to survey, in sufficiently damp conditions. The majority of the  expansive interior was flat and I estimate that four to five 20m grids  could be undertaken per day</p>
