						<p>Prior to the creation of an English tree-ring chronology in  the late 1980s, typology was the main method by which to date a medieval timber-framed structure. Cecil Alec Hewett (1926-1998) pioneered buildings typologies for  medieval carpentry joints and timber-framed buildings in south-eastern England (Gibson and Andrews  1998, online).  In Hewett&rsquo;s seminal work <em>English Historic  Carpentry</em> the inner sleeve reads &ldquo;he [Hewett] has shown that the methods of  assembling timber buildings, particularly the joints used, follow a strict  historical sequence, as datable as ceramics&rdquo; (Hewett 1980a, inner  sleeve).  In the case of Hewett, typology is defined as being &ldquo;historically diagnostic  because they are historically unique, that is, they are &lsquo;peculiar to a given  time and place&rsquo;&rdquo; (Sackett 1977, 371) and therefore, progress from  the archaic to the mechanically advanced in a datable sequence of &lsquo;style and  function&rsquo; (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>

							<p align="justify" class="thrColHybHdr c1">In 1990, Matthew Johnson warned of relying on typologies to  date buildings (Johnson 1990, 247-8) primarily because they are  not always reliable and are based on assumptions rather than science. This Chapter  will address some previous errors made under the auspices of chrono-typologies  forwarded by the likes of; Henri Deneux, Cecil Hewett and J. T. Smith, by  applying corrected dates derived through the scientific practice of  dendrochronology (Pearson 1997, 30-3; VAG  2000).  By &lsquo;recalibrating&rsquo; the existing dates arrived at by typologies and informed  judgement by Hewett <em>et al</em>, with new  solid dates derived from tree-ring analysis, it is hoped Johnson&rsquo;s warning can  be put to one side. This Section will also provide a response to a comment made  by Sarah Pearson in which she suggested &ldquo;one important aspect of construction  which is likely to be considerably advanced through tree-ring dating is the  typology of timber jointing techniques&rdquo; (Pearson 1997, 32).</p>
							<p align="justify" class="thrColHybHdr c1">Cecil Hewett&rsquo;s pioneering works have been a starting place for  many research projects including this one. Because this thesis aims to test  Hewett&rsquo;s hypothesis that late-medieval timber framed structures can be dated by  the joints and carpentry techniques used in their construction in the light of  recent dendrochronological advances; it is important that his typology is also  informed by tree-ring dating. Hewett himself was unable to achieve this in his  lifetime, but this thesis will address by re-visiting his data and updating the  chronology based on recent tree-ring data. Once completed (see Table 12)  this Section will then retest some of Hewett&rsquo;s typological assumptions. In  doing so, some of his original work will be brought into question and  modernised. The resulting recalibrated data will then be compared against the  Hampshire data to test for similarities and anomalies.</p>
							<div align="justify">
                             <p>Cecil Hewett's search focused mainly on the south-eastern county  of Essex, though he also carried out various works in other counties –  including Hampshire. Before Hewett, very few people would dare ascribe a date  for a building to before the 15th or 16th century based  on style alone (Gibson and Andrews  1998, online).  Hewett changed this by firstly studying the barns at Cressing Temple, Essex,  then taking the study further afield and dating other buildings based on the  carpentry joints present in them. Using the Cressing barns as a starting point,  Hewett would date a building based on whether the joints therein appeared older  or newer than those at Cressing Temple. His assumption was that the more  advanced a joint or structure appeared, the newer in the sequence it must be –i.e.  built after the Cressing barn (Hewett 1962, 240). It can be suggested that  Hewett&rsquo;s methodology was one of teleological progression based on &ldquo;The  hypothesis that carpenters&rsquo; joints underwent processes of development towards  mechanical efficiency&rdquo; (Hewett 1980a, 325).

						    <p>As the table below shows, his technique&rsquo;s often yielded reasonably  accurate results. He could however, be very inaccurate. In several instances he  was out by over a hundred years and in one case by as much as 350 years (Table  11).</p>

							<p>If Table 12  is examined, it can be noted that Cecil Hewett has two buildings dated to the  Anglo-Saxon era. Based on these two buildings - The Church of St. Mary,  Sompting, Sussex (Hewett AD950-1050) and the barn at Paul&rsquo;s Hall, Belchamp St  Paul, Essex (Hewett pre-AD 1180) Hewett named Chapter 1 of his Seminal work <em>English Historic Carpentry - &ldquo;</em>Examples  from the Anglo-Saxon Period (AD 449 to 1066)&rdquo; (Hewett 1980a). Of Sompting, Hewett suggests  &ldquo;the structural method at Sompting is competent, and the workmanship wrought  with an assurance that must indicate the previous existence of a long  tradition&rdquo; (Hewett 1980a, 29). Therefore according to  Hewett, carpentry was introduced into England in the early Saxon period and  reached a &lsquo;competent&rsquo; level prior to the Norman Conquest (1066). Both buildings  have since been dendro dated to 1300-30 and 1240-75 respectively and therefore,  not Saxon carpentry at all. Instead Walker suggests carpentry entered England  via the Norman&rsquo;s around AD1180 (Walker 1999, 28).</p>
                            <p>Four examples of Cecil Hewett&rsquo;s work will now be analysed in  greater detail to illustrate both how accurate, and inaccurate, his dating  could be. All four buildings were also surveyed as part of this research in  order to gain a greater insight into Hewett&rsquo;s work and the buildings which  formed his research. The four buildings are listed chronologically:</p>

                            <p>The barley barn is another example of the three different  types of dating - typology, radiocarbon dating (14C) - and much  later - dendrochronology; all being used to investigate one building.

                                <ul>
                                  <li>Cecil Hewett suggested   late 12th to early 13th century (Hewett 1980a, 59-63)</li>
                                  <li>14C dated the barn to 940 +/-70 (c.1023)  (Hewett 1962, 271)</li>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>If the dendrochronologically derived dates are taken as the  most precise (see Section 2.3) Hewett&rsquo;s suggestion was very close. Unfortunately,  Cecil Hewett would never have known how close he was to tree-ring date. Radiocarbon  dating, however, was over 200 years out with an unacceptable date range. These  three examples, of various dating techniques, highlight the importance of the  ability to rely on precise dates, as the implications of inaccurate dates can be profound. Although  Hewett was sure his date was accurate, it did lead him to write &ldquo;this [the  radiocarbon date] suggests a date in the eleventh century, centring on 1023,  for the felling of the oaks used in its original building. It is perhaps  surprising that this date is earlier than the gift of the estate by King Stephen  to the Templar&rsquo;s, but there is no obvious reason why the barn should not have been  built whilst the estate was in the possession of the Crown&rdquo; (Hewett 1962, 271). This would imply that although Hewett  doubted the radiocarbon date, he was open to the idea that it could be  validated.</p>
                            <h4 align="justify">Grange Barn, Coggeshall, Essex</h4>
                            <p>Grange Barn was, originally, Radiocarbon dated (14C)  to 1130 +/-90 (Essex SMR 8808). Oddly though, Cecil Hewett reports the 14C  date as being 1020 +/-90 (Hewett 1980a, 47) but later in the same  publication he agrees with the 14C date (Hewett 1980a, 289). The associated Savignac  Abbey was formed in 1140 and although there is no documentary evidence that  gives a construction date for the barn, it was assumed that the building was  contemporary (<em>Ibid</em>, 47-8). Hewett had  noted the use of open lap joints in its construction (Figure 19)  and therefore, based on this joint and its use in the barley barn at Cressing  Temple, he suggested the barn was built soon after the formation of the Abbey in  the mid 12th century (Andrews 1984). The barn has subsequently  been dendro-dated to between 1237 and 1269 (Tyers et al. 1997, 141) and therefore, a late example  of an open lap joint (Andrews 1984). Hewett also wrote that &ldquo;the  main posts stood upon stone stylobates about an inch larger all round than the  posts&rsquo; feet&rdquo; (Andrews 1984, 49). A stylobate is a raised  stone pad upon which the upright post is placed to mitigate rotting. However,  the Essex SMR suggests that &ldquo;observations during restoration suggest the arcade  posts were originally set on base plates, as proposed initially, and not on  stylobates as suggested by Cecil Hewett in 1980&rdquo; (EssexCC 2003). </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>What should be noted though is that this building, although  framed and free-standing does not employ a ground sill for stability. Whereas the  Barley Barn at Cressing Temple, Essex (c1200 +/-60) of a slightly earlier date does  (Hewett 1980a, 49). The notch lap joints found  in this barn, can also be seen at Wherwell &lsquo;stables&rsquo; in Hampshire (Figure  20)  dendro-dated to 1250 (Roberts 2003, 248). This shows two very similar  and coeval joints in separate parts of the country - Essex and Hampshire. This  type of joint is also common amongst the majority of the buildings examined by  Walker (Walker 1999, 28). Six of the eight buildings  used notched lap joints; the implications of which are explained by Walker: </p>
                            <p><em>&ldquo;These dated buildings  do not support Cecil Hewett suggestion that there was a development from the  late 12th century in the notched lap joint from unrefined entry to secret  notched lap. If there was, it was before the late 12th century. Both the  unrefined entry and refined entry were being used in the late 12th and early  13th century&rdquo;</em>. (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>
                            <h4 align="justify">The wheat barn, <a href="/images/HampshireBuildings/CressingTemple/index.htm">Cressing Temple</a>, Essex </h4>
                            <p>Hewett dated the wheat barn to around 1255 (Hewett 1980a, 102-5). The barn has since been  scientifically dated, by dendrochronology, to 1257-80 (Tyers et al. 1997, 51). As Hewett was fairly  accurate with both the barns at Cressing Temple, Hewett had a solid datum by  which to date other buildings. By his own admission, Hewett would date  buildings based on them appearing less advanced, or more advanced than the  joints at Cressing (Hewett 1962, 240). As he was so accurate with  Cressing Temple barns, one would assume the rest of his chrono-typology would  be fairly accurate too. However, the following case study tells a very  different story and highlights the need for his work to be recalibrated now  dendrochronologically derived dates are available.

                            <h4 align="justify">St Mary&rsquo;s Church, Sompting, West Sussex</h4>
                            <p>The timber frame that supports the western tower at St.  Mary&rsquo;s church, Sompting, West Sussex is of a Rhenish helm type (Figure 21).  Hewett suggests a date &ldquo;somewhere between c AD950 and c 1050. It is unlikely to  be later than this&rdquo; (Hewett 1980a, 15). Due to Hewett&rsquo;s belief that  this church roof dated to pre-conquest England, he wrote &ldquo;The architectural and  structural concept of the Rhenish helm is extraordinary, but its execution in  carpentry at Sompting is a work of such assurance and competence, achieved with  such economy of means, that it both indicates the work of a master and suggests  the previous existence of a tradition of framing such works&rdquo; (Hewett 1989, 15). If this statement were to be  true, it would put the introduction of framing back from AD1180 (Walker 1999, 28) to AD950, before the  introduction of the French style, even before the Norman Conquest (Hewett 1982, 341). Clearly then it is essential  to the understanding of the evolution of carpentry, that this building be  scientifically dated, in order to validate whether 950 or 1180 are to be used  as the start of the carpentry tradition in England. Indeed, Hewett assumes &ldquo;the  structural method at Sompting is competent, and the workmanship wrought with an  assurance that must indicate the previous existence of a long tradition&rdquo; (Hewett 1980a, 29). Therefore, Hewett is  suggesting carpentry existed in England before AD 950 based on Sompting alone  suggesting &ldquo;it is no longer possible to ascribe the introduction of any types  [of carpenters&rsquo; joints] to the Conquest, or the Normans&rdquo; (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>
                            <p>Hewett also notes the use of carpenters&rsquo; marks in the form  of chisel cut Roman numerals, suggesting that the frame was measured and framed  elsewhere. Therefore, Hewett suggests the carpenters who constructed the frame  at Sompting had &ldquo;anticipated ensuing carpenters&rsquo; methods&rdquo; which would not be  seen again until 1180 (Hewett 1989, 15). Even though Hewett was  convinced the roof was Saxon in origin, he noted that some of the joints – &ldquo;a  tenon with one shoulder &lsquo;scribed&rsquo; to fit over a waney edge&rdquo; – are unknown  elsewhere until the 13th century, yet he remained convinced he was  looking at a Saxon roof.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, Hewett&rsquo;s date was off by around 380 years (Aldsworth and Harris  1988, 140; Pearson 1997, 33). In 1985 two timber samples were Radiocarbon  dated to AD 1323 +/-51 by Jill Walker. A tighter date range was sought and in  1987, 17 samples were taken for dendrochronological analysis giving a new date  range of AD 1300 to 1330, by Ian Tyers (Aldsworth and Harris  1988, 140-3; Tyers 1990, 45). It should be noted that the main body of the  church is of a pre-conquest date, it was added to in the later part of the 11th  century which, it seems, Hewett based his date on (Aldsworth and Harris  1988, 139).  Before the recalibration of Hewett&rsquo;s dates for St Mary&rsquo;s church, it is plain to  see the implications that an incorrect date can have our knowledge of the past.  380 years in the medieval to late medieval period sees many profound historical  changes - from Saxon England, through Norman occupation, to the beginning of  the 14th century dominated by famine, plagues and war.</p>

							  <h3>The open hall house</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In England, by the end of the fourteenth century, it is thought that the fully developed medieval hall arrangement had been attained. That is to say - the addition of two compartments either side of the open hall house to accommodate the service rooms and living quarters, forming a tripartite design, had become common place.</p>

							  <h3>The black death</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This paper aims to examine the effects of the black death upon english architecture. It is not aimed at being a definitive essay on the black death as a whole. Therefore, the text focusses on how architecture can teach us about how people built in response to the greatest natural disaster of the middle ages.</p>
